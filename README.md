# Software-Design-Document

1. Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
   The client, The Gaming Room, wanted to have a version of their game, Draw It or Lose It, developed as a web-based game that can run on several different platforms.
2. What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
   I think I did good job of explaining the different features of the various operating systems/platforms.
3. What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
   It helped keep me on track and filling out the design document helped me better understand exactly what the client was looking for and how to better achieve it.
4. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
   I might change the recommendations section. I think I could do an even better job of going into detail on the different recommendations and how each aspect of a certain platform informed my recommendations.
5. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
   I simply understood the rules of the games and how a user may interact with the game and coded accordingly to accomodate for the user's view, as well. When designing a game, or just about any program, you have to be 
   cognizant of the user's experience and make sure it is easy to use. Otherwise, they make not come back to the game or service.
6. How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
   First and foremost, I kept the client's desires in mind. I knew the rules of the game, the security features they wanted, etc and made sure to include them. In the future, I think having a design document of this sort 
   helps for my understanding of the project and ultimately leads to a more complete product and one that is more in line with the client's goals.
